OML4R: Native OML Implementation in Ruby			{#oml4rdoc}
========================================

This is a simple client library for OML which does not use liboml2 and its
filters, but connects directly to the server using the text protocol [oml-text].
User can use this library to create ruby applications which can send
measurement to the OML collection server. A simple example on how to use
this library is attached at the end of this file. Another example can be
found in the file oml4r-example.rb

Installation
------------

OML4R is available from RubyGems [oml4r-rubygem].

    $ gem install oml4r


Usage
-----

### Definition of a Measurement Point

    class MyMP < OML4R::MPBase
      name :mymp
    
      param :mystring
      param :myint, :type => :int32
      param :mydouble, :type => :double
    end

### Initialisation, Injection and Tear-down

    OML4R::init(ARGV, {
    	:appName => 'oml4rSimpleExample',
    	:expID => 'foo',
    	:nodeID => 'n1',
    	:omlServer => 'file:-'}
    )
    MyMP.inject("hello", 13, 37.)
    OML4R::close()

### Real example

See examples files oml4r-simple-example.rb and oml4r-wlanconfig.rb.
